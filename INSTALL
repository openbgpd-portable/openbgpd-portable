1. Prerequisites
----------------

You will need an entropy (randomness) source.  If your OS has arc4random or
getentropy then that is ideal. Otherwise, you can use the builtin arc4random
implementation or the one built into LibreSSL.

2. Building / Installation
--------------------------

If you have checked this source using Git, follow these initial steps to
prepare the source tree for building:

 1. ensure you have the following packages installed:
      automake, autoconf, git, libtool, yacc or byacc (bison does not work)
      On Linux systems set YACC=byacc before running ./configure.
 2. run './autogen.sh' to prepare the source tree for building
    or run './dist.sh' to prepare a tarball.

To install OpenBGPD with default options:

./configure
make
make install

This will install the OpenBGPD binary in /usr/local/sbin, configuration
files in /usr/local/etc. To specify a different installation prefix,
use the --prefix option to configure:

./configure --prefix=/opt
make
make install

Will install OpenBGPD in /opt/{etc,sbin}. You can also override
specific paths, for example:

./configure --prefix=/opt --sysconfdir=/etc/bgpd
make
make install

This will install the binaries in /opt/sbin, but will place the
configuration files in /etc/bgpd.

OpenBGPD always uses Privilege Separation (ie the majority of the
processing is done as a chroot'ed, unprivileged user).

This requires that a user, group and directory to be created for it.
The user should not be permitted to log in, and its home directory
should be owned by root and be mode 755.

If you do "make install", the Makefile will create the directory with
the correct permissions and will prompt you for the rest if required.
If, however, you need to perform all of these tasks yourself (eg if you
are moving the built binaries to another system) then you will need to
do something like the following (although the exact commands required
for creating the user and group are system dependant):

On most Linux and BSD systems, something like should work:

 groupadd _bgpd
 useradd -g _bgpd -s /sbin/nologin -d /var/empty -c 'OpenBGPD daemon' _bgpd
 mkdir -p /var/empty
 chown 0 /var/empty
 chgrp 0 /var/empty
 chmod 0755 /var/empty

OpenBGPD is using the home directory of the _bgpd user (/var/empty by default)
as the chroot directory for privilege separation of the session engine and the
route decision engine processes. This directory should not contain any files,
must be owned by root, and must not be group or world-writable.

There are a few options to the configure script in addition to the ones
provided by autoconf itself:

--with-privsep-user=[user]
 Specify unprivileged user used for privilege separation.  The default
 is "_bgpd".

If you need to pass special options to the compiler or linker, you
can specify these as environment variables before running ./configure.
For example:

CFLAGS="-O2 " LDFLAGS="-s" ./configure

3. Configuration
----------------

The runtime configuration files are installed by in ${prefix}/etc or
whatever you specified as your --sysconfdir (/usr/local/etc by default).

4. Problems?
------------

If you experience problems compiling, installing or running OpenBGPD,
please report the problem to the address in the README file.
